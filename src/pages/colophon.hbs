        <p>I purchased the frankmtaylor domain over a decade ago when I began a job search. This site was my playground first. Building and rebuilding this site helped me learn what front-end development was all about. The added bonus was that I could also make it my resume.</p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>All of the content on this site is my own. It is boring because it came from my own brain and not AI.</p>
        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>With the exception of the normalize, I wrote all of the code you see here by hand using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_new">Visual Studio Code</a>. Previous versions were built with Sublime Text or notepad. No code was generated using any sort of CoPilot or AI tool.</p>
        <p>This site was built using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank"> Gulp</a>, <a href="http://assemble.io/" target="_blank">Assemble.io</a> (which includes some Handlebars), and spare time.</p>
        <p>This site is deployed using Github Actions.</p>
        <p>You can see the source code for this site on <a class="icon" href="https://github.com/paceaux/resumeandcv"> Github </a>.</p>    
        <h2>Icons</h2>
        <p>Most icons come from <a href="https://simpleicons.org/">Simple Icons</a>. The JSFiddle logo comes from <a href="https://www.svgrepo.com">SVG Repo</a>.
        <h2>Font</h2>
        <p>The font is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a>. It is being served by your computer. </p>
