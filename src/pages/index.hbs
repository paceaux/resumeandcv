        <h1>Howdy</h1>
        <p>My name is Frank. This is my site. Don't think of this as another online resume. Think of this as a better way to get to know me. 
        </p>
        <p>I'm a lot of things. In the past I've been a business analyst, a content producer, a trainer, even some schlub taking phone calls in a call center in three languages (English, French, Spanish). </p>
        <p>Today I'm a Senior front-end Drupal Engineer. Tomorrow I could be a CMS Architect. A few years from now I might be a linguist. Who knows?</p>
        <h2>I want to make cool stuff that people want to use</h2>
        <p>I'm especially interested in languages, education, and apps that can help marginalized and underserved communities. If you or someone you knoe likes doing that stuff then we should talk.  <a href="https://paceaux.com">My handle for the internet is paceaux</a>, you should look for me there.
